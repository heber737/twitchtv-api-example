# Twitch.tv API Use Example

## Project Description

This project is part of my personal curriculum, and it shows a simple use case for the Twitchtv API. It allows the user to edit a default list of Twitch channel's IDs, and it will display a list of cards with basic info about each channel and a link to the streamer's profile.

## Technology Stack

- Basic HTML5 for the app entry point.
- Tailwind CSS for styling, along with minimal custom CSS for the fonts.
- React
- Vite
- Node Package Manager
- Node.js
- Local Storage for storing the channel list.

I am still not satisfied with the general layout and maybe will update it with some custom Tailwind components in the future.

## How to Install and Run this App

- Make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js and Node Package Manager installed on your machine.
- Clone this repository to a local folder on your machine.
- Open a terminal in the main folder of the project and run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
- Finally, run `npm run dev`, then navigate to http://localhost:5173/ in your web browser to use the app.
